To enable sending of email from rails development environment on a mac:

sudo vi /etc/postfix/main.cf
 
search for and comment out the following line:
 
    # (APPLE) Credentials for using URLAUTH with IMAP servers.
    #imap_submit_cred_file = /etc/postfix/submit.cred

add the following lines to your rails config/environments/development.rb file

  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }
  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
  config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = true
  config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true

BE SURE TO SET perform_deliveries TO FALSE when you're done testing to avoid
upsetting upstream mail providers!

Also, uncomment the line in /etc/postfix/main.cf on your DBC Mac when you're 
done for the day.


Once you've reconfigured the two files above, run the following from the command line:

 sudo postfix start

this will start the postfix server.

After testing, run
	
	sudo postfix stop

to disable mail sending.
